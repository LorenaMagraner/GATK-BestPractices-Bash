# gatk4-data-processing

### Purpose :
Workflows for processing high-throughput sequencing data for variant discovery with GATK4 and related tools.

### processing-for-variant-discovery-gatk4 :
The processing-for-variant-discovery-gatk4 WDL pipeline implements data pre-processing according to the GATK Best Practices.  

#### Requirements/expectations:
- Pair-end sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format
- One or more read groups, one per uBAM file, all belonging to a single sample (SM)
- Input uBAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements:
  - filenames all have the same suffix (we use ".unmapped.bam")
  - files must pass validation by ValidateSamFile 
  - reads are provided in query-sorted order
  - all reads must have an RG tag
- Reference index files must be in the same directory as source (e.g. reference.fasta.fai in the same directory as reference.fasta)

#### Outputs: 
- A clean BAM file and its index, suitable for variant discovery analyses.

### Software version requirements :
- GATK 4 or later
- BWA 0.7.15-r1140
- Picard 2.16.0-SNAPSHOT
- Samtools 1.3.1 (using htslib 1.3.1)
- Python 2.7
- Cromwell version support 
  - Successfully tested on v37 
  - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax
